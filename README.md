# CLIngman
CLIngman is a hangman game built with NodeJS using constructors.

This is a command line game, so to play the game, you must fork it and run with "npm start". 

npm packages used: 

* Lodash
* Inquirer
* Is-letter
* Request (used to get words for game creation, not as part of the game)

[Demo as gif](http://www.ihatetoast.com/projects.html)

APIs used: [DataMuse](https://api.datamuse.com/api) to help me come up with scores of words in seconds, which allowed me more time for the logic.
