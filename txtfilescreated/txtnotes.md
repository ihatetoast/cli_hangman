# Txt files

I was too lazy to come up with my own words, so I called to an API (datamuse) to get words related to five words: animals, food, emotions, sports, and programming. 

With the data returned, I logged them to a txt file. That gave me enough to then make my own arrays. 

These files are not part of the working game, but they were used to build it, so here they stay.
